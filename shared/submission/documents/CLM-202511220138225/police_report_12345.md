## NARRATIVE

At approximately 1:30 PM on November 10, 2025, I was dispatched to a two-vehicle collision on I-95 Northbound near Mile Marker 42. Upon arrival, I observed two vehicles on the right shoulder with moderate rear-end damage to Vehicle 1 and front-end damage to Vehicle 2.

**Driver Statement (Vehicle 1 - John Smith):**  
Mr. Smith stated he was traveling northbound on I-95 in the right lane when traffic slowed for a red light at the MD-43 overpass. He came to a complete stop and was waiting for the light to change when he felt a sudden impact from behind. Mr. Smith stated he was not injured but experienced minor neck discomfort. His vehicle sustained damage to the rear bumper, trunk lid, and rear quarter panel.

**Driver Statement (Vehicle 2 - Jane Doe):**  
Ms. Doe stated she was following Mr. Smith's vehicle northbound when she looked down briefly to adjust her vehicle's climate controls. When she looked up, traffic had stopped for the red light. She applied her brakes but was unable to stop in time due to the wet road conditions and struck the rear of Vehicle 1. Ms. Doe admitted fault and stated she was distracted. She reported no injuries.

**Witness Statement (Vehicle 3):**  
A witness in the adjacent lane (Michael Johnson, 410-555-9999) corroborated both statements, confirming that Vehicle 1 was fully stopped when Vehicle 2 struck it from behind.
