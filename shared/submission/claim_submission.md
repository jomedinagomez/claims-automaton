Subject: Claim for car accident yesterday
Date: Monday, November 11, 2025 at 8:15 AM

Hi,

I need to file a claim for an accident that happened yesterday (Nov 10th) on I-95 North around 1:30pm. I was stopped at a red light near mile marker 42 when someone rear-ended me. It was raining pretty hard.

My policy number is AUTO-789456. The car is a 2020 Toyota Camry.

The police came and filed a report - I've attached it along with the other paperwork. The other driver got a ticket. There was also a witness who saw everything happen.

I went to the doctor this morning because my neck has been hurting since the accident. They took x-rays and said it's a cervical strain. I've attached the medical summary.

I also got an estimate from Honest Auto Body for the damage to my rear bumper and trunk. They said it'll take about 4-5 days to fix. I think they're one of your approved shops?

I've attached:
- police_report_12345.md (the official police report)
- repair_estimate_001.md (from Honest Auto Body)
- medical_receipt_summary.md (from the orthopedic clinic visit)
- witness_statement.txt (statement from the witness)

Can you let me know what happens next? I'd like to get the car repaired as soon as possible, and I'll probably need a rental while it's in the shop.

Thanks,
John Smith
