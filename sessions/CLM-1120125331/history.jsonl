I was stopped at a red light near mile marker 42 when someone rear-ended me. It was raining pretty hard.\n\nMy policy number is AUTO-789456. The car is a 2020 Toyota Camry.\n\nThe police came and filed a report - I've attached it along with the other paperwork. The other driver got a ticket. There was also a witness who saw everything happen.\n\nI went to the doctor this morning because my neck has been hurting since the accident. They took x-rays and said it's a cervical strain. I've attached the medical summary.\n\nI also got an estimate from Honest Auto Body for the damage to my rear bumper and trunk. They said it'll take about 4-5 days to fix. I think they're one of your approved shops?\n\nI've attached:\n- police_report_12345.md (the official police report)\n- repair_estimate_001.md (from Honest Auto Body)\n- medical_receipt_summary.md (from the orthopedic clinic visit)\n- witness_statement.txt (statement from the witness)\n\nCan you let me know what happens next? I'd like to get the car repaired as soon as possible, and I'll probably need a rental while it's in the shop.\n\nThanks,\nJohn Smith\n410-555-1234\njohn.smith@example.com\n", "name": null, "metadata": {}}
