I was stopped at a red light near mile marker 42 when someone rear-ended me. It was raining pretty hard.\r\n\r\nMy policy number is AUTO-789456. The car is a 2020 Toyota Camry.\r\n\r\nThe police came and filed a report - I've attached it along with the other paperwork. The other driver got a ticket. There was also a witness who saw everything happen.\r\n\r\nI went to the doctor this morning because my neck has been hurting since the accident. They took x-rays and said it's a cervical strain. I've attached the medical summary.\r\n\r\nI also got an estimate from Honest Auto Body for the damage to my rear bumper and trunk. They said it'll take about 4-5 days to fix. I think they're one of your approved shops?\r\n\r\nI've attached:\r\n- police_report_12345.md (the official police report)\r\n- repair_estimate_001.md (from Honest Auto Body)\r\n- medical_receipt_summary.md (from the orthopedic clinic visit)\r\n- witness_statement.txt (statement from the witness)\r\n\r\nCan you let me know what happens next? I'd like to get the car repaired as soon as possible, and I'll probably need a rental while it's in the shop.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJohn Smith\r\n410-555-1234\r\njohn.smith@example.com", "name": null, "metadata": {"agent_id": "85167e96-114a-4487-830f-3f0aaec71381"}}
