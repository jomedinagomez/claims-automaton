Your policy (AUTO-789456) is currently active, but its effective dates are January 1, 2025, through January 1, 2026. The accident occurred on November 10, 2023, which is before your policy began.

Unfortunately, your automobile insurance policy was not in force on the date of the reported accident, so coverage does not apply to this claim. 

If you have another policy or need guidance regarding other possible avenues, please let me know.
