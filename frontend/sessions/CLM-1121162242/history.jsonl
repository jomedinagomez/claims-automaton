I was stopped at a red light near mile marker 42 when someone rear-ended me. It was raining pretty hard.\r\n\r\nMy policy number is AUTO-789456. The car is a 2020 Toyota Camry.\r\n\r\nThe police came and filed a report - I've attached it along with the other paperwork. The other driver got a ticket. There was also a witness who saw everything happen.\r\n\r\nI went to the doctor this morning because my neck has been hurting since the accident. They took x-rays and said it's a cervical strain. I've attached the medical summary.\r\n\r\nI also got an estimate from Honest Auto Body for the damage to my rear bumper and trunk. They said it'll take about 4-5 days to fix. I think they're one of your approved shops?\r\n\r\nI've attached:\r\n- police_report_12345.md (the official police report)\r\n- repair_estimate_001.md (from Honest Auto Body)\r\n- medical_receipt_summary.md (from the orthopedic clinic visit)\r\n- witness_statement.txt (statement from the witness)\r\n\r\nCan you let me know what happens next? I'd like to get the car repaired as soon as possible, and I'll probably need a rental while it's in the shop.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJohn Smith\r\n410-555-1234\r\njohn.smith@example.com", "name": null, "metadata": {"agent_id": "ea3bdc44-d2ed-426f-96ef-abc1881e9901"}}

This does not automatically indicate fraud (delays and data lags are common), but you should be prepared to provide a clearer copy or alternative supporting details if requested.\n\nSummary:\n- No fraud or blacklist concerns.\n- No duplicate claim risk.\n- Weather description is plausible; the incident is consistent with available data.\n- Police report could not be immediately validated; further supporting documentation may be requested as part of standard review.\n\nRecommendation:\nProceed with detailed claim review and alert the claimant that routine follow-up for police report authentication may be needed.
