I was stopped at a red light near mile marker 42 when someone rear-ended me. It was raining pretty hard.\r\n\r\nMy policy number is AUTO-789456. The car is a 2020 Toyota Camry.\r\n\r\nThe police came and filed a report - I've attached it along with the other paperwork. The other driver got a ticket. There was also a witness who saw everything happen.\r\n\r\nI went to the doctor this morning because my neck has been hurting since the accident. They took x-rays and said it's a cervical strain. I've attached the medical summary.\r\n\r\nI also got an estimate from Honest Auto Body for the damage to my rear bumper and trunk. They said it'll take about 4-5 days to fix. I think they're one of your approved shops?\r\n\r\nI've attached:\r\n- police_report_12345.md (the official police report)\r\n- repair_estimate_001.md (from Honest Auto Body)\r\n- medical_receipt_summary.md (from the orthopedic clinic visit)\r\n- witness_statement.txt (statement from the witness)\r\n\r\nCan you let me know what happens next? I'd like to get the car repaired as soon as possible, and I'll probably need a rental while it's in the shop.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJohn Smith\r\n410-555-1234\r\njohn.smith@example.com", "name": null, "metadata": {"agent_id": "6194823c-fb89-4e60-857d-c83c5782f92a"}}

Damage as result of rear-end accident (by third party, documented) typically qualifies.\n- Medical payments: Policy lists a $5,000 limit, but claim matrix coverage specifics not found; however, standard policies usually apply for acute accident-related injuries such as cervical strain.\n- Rental reimbursement: Policy documents do not specify eligibility or coverage for rental costs; the claim matrix did not surface clear rules. Please check your declarations page or contact the adjuster for confirmation of rental reimbursement for this policy tier (standard).\n\nExclusions (general for auto policies): Coverage may not apply if the driver was intoxicated, using the car for commercial purposes, or if damages pre-dated the policy. Your submission does not indicate any such exclusions.\n\nValidity of claim: Accident falls within covered events (collision with another vehicle, personal injury), and all required documentation has been provided. Claim is valid and reviewable.\n\nWhat happens next: An adjuster will contact you to review details, confirm rental eligibility, and help coordinate repair at Honest Auto Body.\n\nIf you need specific confirmation about rental coverage, please provide your policy declarations page or ask the adjuster for policy-specific terms.
