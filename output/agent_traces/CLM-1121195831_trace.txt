Subject: Claim for car accident yesterday
Date: Monday, November 11, 2025 at 8:15 AM

Hi,

I need to file a claim for an accident that happened yesterday (Nov 10th) on I-95 North around 1:30pm. I was stopped at a red light near mile marker 42 when someone rear-ended me. It was raining pretty hard.

My policy number is AUTO-789456. The car is a 2020 Toyota Camry.

The police came and filed a report - I've attached it along with the other paperwork. The other driver got a ticket. There was also a witness who saw everything happen.

I went to the doctor this morning because my neck has been hurting since the accident. They took x-rays and said it's a cervical strain. I've attached the medical summary.

I also got an estimate from Honest Auto Body for the damage to my rear bumper and trunk. They said it'll take about 4-5 days to fix. I think they're one of your approved shops?

I've attached:
- police_report_12345.md (the official police report)
- repair_estimate_001.md (from Honest Auto Body)
- medical_receipt_summary.md (from the orthopedic clinic visit)
- witness_statement.txt (statement from the witness)

Can you let me know what happens next? I'd like to get the car repaired as soon as possible, and I'll probably need a rental while it's in the shop.

Thanks,

Thank you for providing the information and documentation regarding your accident on November 10, 2025. Here’s an overview of your policy and the next steps for your claim:

Policy Status and Coverage:
- Your policy (AUTO-789456) is active and in good standing. It is a "Standard" tier auto policy, effective through January 1, 2026.
- The vehicle insured is your 2020 Toyota Camry.
- The type of claim reported—a collision (being rear-ended)—generally falls under "collision" coverage for repairs, and medical payments for injury treatment.

Claim Type Validity and Coverage:
- Collision Coverage: Your policy does include collision coverage with a $500 deductible, up to $25,000 per incident.
- Medical Payments: Your policy includes up to $5,000 in medical payments coverage for injury treatment after an accident.
- Rental Reimbursement: I am unable to confirm rental reimbursement coverage from your policy matrix at this time. We may need to verify this directly with your policy documents or an agent.

Exclusions/Additional Considerations:
- There are no indications that this type of incident (accident caused by another driver, not yourself, with police report and witness statement) falls under any standard exclusions.
- Repair work at approved shops and medical treatment for accident-related injuries are typically eligible, subject to deductible and coverage limits.

Next Steps:
1. Your claim for both vehicle damage and medical treatment is valid and will proceed, subject to your deductible and policy limits.
2. Please provide your proof of insurance if requested by the adjuster for documentation purposes.
3. We are checking if you have rental car coverage. If confirmed, this would apply while your car is in the shop.
4. A claims adjuster will contact you for additional details as needed and guide you through authorizing repairs and reimbursement for medical expenses.

Let us know if you have questions about your deductible, claim coverage, or next steps. We’ll confirm the rental reimbursement coverage as soon as we have your complete coverage matrix.

Subject: Claim for car accident yesterday
Date: Monday, November 11, 2025 at 8:15 AM

Hi,

I need to file a claim for an accident that happened yesterday (Nov 10th) on I-95 North around 1:30pm. I was stopped at a red light near mile marker 42 when someone rear-ended me. It was raining pretty hard.

My policy number is AUTO-789456. The car is a 2020 Toyota Camry.

The police came and filed a report - I've attached it along with the other paperwork. The other driver got a ticket. There was also a witness who saw everything happen.

I went to the doctor this morning because my neck has been hurting since the accident. They took x-rays and said it's a cervical strain. I've attached the medical summary.

I also got an estimate from Honest Auto Body for the damage to my rear bumper and trunk. They said it'll take about 4-5 days to fix. I think they're one of your approved shops?

I've attached:
- police_report_12345.md (the official police report)
- repair_estimate_001.md (from Honest Auto Body)
- medical_receipt_summary.md (from the orthopedic clinic visit)
- witness_statement.txt (statement from the witness)

Can you let me know what happens next? I'd like to get the car repaired as soon as possible, and I'll probably need a rental while it's in the shop.

Thanks,

Subject: Claim for car accident yesterday
Date: Monday, November 11, 2025 at 8:15 AM

Hi,

I need to file a claim for an accident that happened yesterday (Nov 10th) on I-95 North around 1:30pm. I was stopped at a red light near mile marker 42 when someone rear-ended me. It was raining pretty hard.

My policy number is AUTO-789456. The car is a 2020 Toyota Camry.

The police came and filed a report - I've attached it along with the other paperwork. The other driver got a ticket. There was also a witness who saw everything happen.

I went to the doctor this morning because my neck has been hurting since the accident. They took x-rays and said it's a cervical strain. I've attached the medical summary.

I also got an estimate from Honest Auto Body for the damage to my rear bumper and trunk. They said it'll take about 4-5 days to fix. I think they're one of your approved shops?

I've attached:
- police_report_12345.md (the official police report)
- repair_estimate_001.md (from Honest Auto Body)
- medical_receipt_summary.md (from the orthopedic clinic visit)
- witness_statement.txt (statement from the witness)

Can you let me know what happens next? I'd like to get the car repaired as soon as possible, and I'll probably need a rental while it's in the shop.

Thanks,

Subject: Claim for car accident yesterday
Date: Monday, November 11, 2025 at 8:15 AM

Hi,

I need to file a claim for an accident that happened yesterday (Nov 10th) on I-95 North around 1:30pm. I was stopped at a red light near mile marker 42 when someone rear-ended me. It was raining pretty hard.

My policy number is AUTO-789456. The car is a 2020 Toyota Camry.

The police came and filed a report - I've attached it along with the other paperwork. The other driver got a ticket. There was also a witness who saw everything happen.

I went to the doctor this morning because my neck has been hurting since the accident. They took x-rays and said it's a cervical strain. I've attached the medical summary.

I also got an estimate from Honest Auto Body for the damage to my rear bumper and trunk. They said it'll take about 4-5 days to fix. I think they're one of your approved shops?

I've attached:
- police_report_12345.md (the official police report)
- repair_estimate_001.md (from Honest Auto Body)
- medical_receipt_summary.md (from the orthopedic clinic visit)
- witness_statement.txt (statement from the witness)

Can you let me know what happens next? I'd like to get the car repaired as soon as possible, and I'll probably need a rental while it's in the shop.

Thanks,

Next Steps:
- Once you provide the proof of insurance, your claim will be routed for deeper analysis and processing—including repair authorizations and rental car arrangements.
- You’ll receive updates at each stage, and we’ll reach out if anything else is needed.

A confirmation of this intake is being sent to your email. Let us know if you have questions, and please attach the proof of insurance at your earliest convenience to avoid delays.

Claim Type Validity and Coverage:
- Collision Coverage: Your policy does include collision coverage with a $500 deductible, up to $25,000 per incident.
- Medical Payments: Your policy includes up to $5,000 in medical payments coverage for injury treatment after an accident.
- Rental Reimbursement: I am unable to confirm rental reimbursement coverage from your policy matrix at this time. We may need to verify this directly with your policy documents or an agent.

Exclusions/Additional Considerations:
- There are no indications that this type of incident (accident caused by another driver, not yourself, with police report and witness statement) falls under any standard exclusions.
- Repair work at approved shops and medical treatment for accident-related injuries are typically eligible, subject to deductible and coverage limits.

Next Steps:

2. Please provide your proof of insurance if requested by the adjuster for documentation purposes.
3. We are checking if you have rental car coverage. If confirmed, this would apply while your car is in the shop.
4. A claims adjuster will contact you for additional details as needed and guide you through authorizing repairs and reimbursement for medical expenses.

2. Incident Details Received:
- Accident occurred on I-95 North (mile marker 42) at 1:30pm, during heavy rain.
- Documentation provided: police report, repair estimate from Honest Auto Body, medical summary for cervical strain, and witness statement.

3. Documentation Alert:
- One required item is missing: Proof of Insurance (a copy of your insurance card or policy declaration page). Please email or upload this to complete the initial review. All other documents are received.

Next Steps:
- Once you provide the proof of insurance, your claim will be routed for deeper analysis and processing—including repair authorizations and rental car arrangements.
- You’ll receive updates at each stage, and we’ll reach out if anything else is needed.

A confirmation of this intake is being sent to your email. Let us know if you have questions, and please attach the proof of insurance at your earliest convenience to avoid delays.
03. AuthorRole.ASSISTANT: Thank you for providing the information and documentation regarding your accident on November 10, 2025. Here’s an overview of your policy and the next steps for your claim:

Policy Status and Coverage:
- Your policy (AUTO-789456) is active and in good standing. It is a "Standard" tier auto policy, effective through January 1, 2026.
- The vehicle insured is your 2020 Toyota Camry.
- The type of claim reported—a collision (being rear-ended)—generally falls under "collision" coverage for repairs, and medical payments for injury treatment.

Claim Type Validity and Coverage:
- Collision Coverage: Your policy does include collision coverage with a $500 deductible, up to $25,000 per incident.
- Medical Payments: Your policy includes up to $5,000 in medical payments coverage for injury treatment after an accident.
- Rental Reimbursement: I am unable to confirm rental reimbursement coverage from your policy matrix at this time. We may need to verify this directly with your policy documents or an agent.

Exclusions/Additional Considerations:
- There are no indications that this type of incident (accident caused by another driver, not yourself, with police report and witness statement) falls under any standard exclusions.
- Repair work at approved shops and medical treatment for accident-related injuries are typically eligible, subject to deductible and coverage limits.

Next Steps:
1. Your claim for both vehicle damage and medical treatment is valid and will proceed, subject to your deductible and policy limits.
2. Please provide your proof of insurance if requested by the adjuster for documentation purposes.
3. We are checking if you have rental car coverage. If confirmed, this would apply while your car is in the shop.
4. A claims adjuster will contact you for additional details as needed and guide you through authorizing repairs and reimbursement for medical expenses.

Let us know if you have questions about your deductible, claim coverage, or next steps. We’ll confirm the rental reimbursement coverage as soon as we have your complete coverage matrix.

Next Steps:

- If you haven’t already, provide a copy of your proof of insurance.
- Once these documents are validated, and rental coverage is confirmed, your claim can proceed.

No indications of fraud, blacklisting, or duplicate claims have been detected at this stage. However, the police report requires further verification.

Subject: Claim for car accident yesterday
Date: Monday, November 11, 2025 at 8:15 AM

Hi,

I need to file a claim for an accident that happened yesterday (Nov 10th) on I-95 North around 1:30pm. I was stopped at a red light near mile marker 42 when someone rear-ended me. It was raining pretty hard.

My policy number is AUTO-789456. The car is a 2020 Toyota Camry.

The police came and filed a report - I've attached it along with the other paperwork. The other driver got a ticket. There was also a witness who saw everything happen.

I went to the doctor this morning because my neck has been hurting since the accident. They took x-rays and said it's a cervical strain. I've attached the medical summary.

I also got an estimate from Honest Auto Body for the damage to my rear bumper and trunk. They said it'll take about 4-5 days to fix. I think they're one of your approved shops?

I've attached:
- police_report_12345.md (the official police report)
- repair_estimate_001.md (from Honest Auto Body)
- medical_receipt_summary.md (from the orthopedic clinic visit)
- witness_statement.txt (statement from the witness)

Can you let me know what happens next? I'd like to get the car repaired as soon as possible, and I'll probably need a rental while it's in the shop.

Thanks,

[2025-11-22T00:59:25.767729Z] Medical_Specialist OUTPUT
Medical Claim Code Validation Results:
- "Cervical strain," "x-ray," and "orthopedic clinic visit" are descriptions and NOT valid billable ICD-10 or CPT codes. For claims processing, a physician or clinic should provide standardized codes (e.g., ICD-10 for diagnosis, CPT for procedures).
- This means your medical summary must include specific codes (e.g., ICD-10: S13.4 for cervical strain, CPT: 72040 for cervical spine x-ray), not just general descriptions.

Next Steps:
- Ask your medical provider or clinic for a detailed bill with these standardized ICD/CPT codes to ensure your claim is processed quickly and correctly.
- Once you receive the coded bill, resubmit or upload it for claim review and payment validation.

Subject: Claim for car accident yesterday
Date: Monday, November 11, 2025 at 8:15 AM

Hi,

I need to file a claim for an accident that happened yesterday (Nov 10th) on I-95 North around 1:30pm. I was stopped at a red light near mile marker 42 when someone rear-ended me. It was raining pretty hard.

My policy number is AUTO-789456. The car is a 2020 Toyota Camry.

The police came and filed a report - I've attached it along with the other paperwork. The other driver got a ticket. There was also a witness who saw everything happen.

I went to the doctor this morning because my neck has been hurting since the accident. They took x-rays and said it's a cervical strain. I've attached the medical summary.

I also got an estimate from Honest Auto Body for the damage to my rear bumper and trunk. They said it'll take about 4-5 days to fix. I think they're one of your approved shops?

I've attached:
- police_report_12345.md (the official police report)
- repair_estimate_001.md (from Honest Auto Body)
- medical_receipt_summary.md (from the orthopedic clinic visit)
- witness_statement.txt (statement from the witness)

Can you let me know what happens next? I'd like to get the car repaired as soon as possible, and I'll probably need a rental while it's in the shop.

Thanks,
John Smith

- Your policy (AUTO-789456) is active and in good standing. It is a "Standard" tier auto policy, effective through January 1, 2026.
- The vehicle insured is your 2020 Toyota Camry.
- The type of claim reported—a collision (being rear-ended)—generally falls under "collision" coverage for repairs, and medical payments for injury treatment.

Claim Type Validity and Coverage:
- Collision Coverage: Your policy does include collision coverage with a $500 deductible, up to $25,000 per incident.
- Medical Payments: Your policy includes up to $5,000 in medical payments coverage for injury treatment after an accident.
- Rental Reimbursement: I am unable to confirm rental reimbursement coverage from your policy matrix at this time. We may need to verify this directly with your policy documents or an agent.

Exclusions/Additional Considerations:
- There are no indications that this type of incident (accident caused by another driver, not yourself, with police report and witness statement) falls under any standard exclusions.
- Repair work at approved shops and medical treatment for accident-related injuries are typically eligible, subject to deductible and coverage limits.

Next Steps:
1. Your claim for both vehicle damage and medical treatment is valid and will proceed, subject to your deductible and policy limits.
2. Please provide your proof of insurance if requested by the adjuster for documentation purposes.
3. We are checking if you have rental car coverage. If confirmed, this would apply while your car is in the shop.
4. A claims adjuster will contact you for additional details as needed and guide you through authorizing repairs and reimbursement for medical expenses.

Let us know if you have questions about your deductible, claim coverage, or next steps. We’ll confirm the rental reimbursement coverage as soon as we have your complete coverage matrix.
