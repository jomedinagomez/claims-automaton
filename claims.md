## Auto Collision (Commuter Rear-End)
```
Hi, I need to file an auto claim. Policy number POL-789456. I was rear-ended on November 10, 2025 around 7:45 AM on I-95 North near mile marker 42 in Fairfax, VA while driving to work. The other driver admitted fault and the police filed report 12345. My 2022 Honda Civic has a crushed bumper and trunk; the repair estimate from Honest Auto Body is $4,850 and I’ve already uploaded the police report, repair estimate, medical receipt for a precautionary cervical strain check, and my passenger’s witness statement. Please let me know if you need anything else.

## Property Damage (Storm Roof Leak)
```
Hello, policy number HOM-552211. During the thunderstorm on October 3, 2025 a large branch fell on my roof at 418 Juniper Lane, Austin, TX. It tore shingles and caused a leak over the kitchen. Licensed roofer Hill Country Exteriors quoted $12,400 for emergency tarping plus replacement of damaged trusses and drywall. I’ve uploaded the contractor estimate, photos of the damage, and the weather service alert that matches the time of the storm. Can you help me submit this claim?

## Medical (Slip and Fall)
```
I’m submitting a medical claim under policy MED-338877. On September 18, 2025 I slipped on wet flooring at a grocery store in Denver and sprained my wrist. Urgent Care Denver billed $1,180 covering x-rays, brace, and follow-up visit. I have the medical summary, itemized receipt, and incident report from the store manager ready to upload. Please confirm if you need additional documentation before we finalize the claim.

## Tips When Tweaking These Prompts
- Keep the policy number, incident date, incident type, location, description, estimated cost, and document list in every message.
- Mention any police report or vendor estimate numbers so the agent can reference them later.
- If you don’t have a document yet, explicitly call it out (e.g., “waiting on repair invoice”) so the agent can track it as missing information.
